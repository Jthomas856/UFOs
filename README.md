# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to create a dynamic webpage, using javascript and bootstrap, to display UFO sightings based on user input. The webpage built will allow for the page to be filtered by multiple criteria at the same time in order to find specific UFO sightings used for analysis. The end page will have filters for date, city, state, country and shape to pull data from a javascript data file and display on the webpage.

## Results

In order to perform a search on the page, the user can input information into the prompts under Filter Search. Multiple inputs can be entered in order to filter the table. The data is pulled from our Javascript file and will display data based on the inputs. The filters can be cleared and the table will be reset to the original data displayed upon first visiting the webpage.

## Summary
We have created a dynamic page that allows for user interaction, however there are limitations to the page. The inputs only allow for exact matches to the data, so if a user misspells a city or uses different capitalizations then the data will not display on the table. The user would have to know how the data is displayed, or would have to scroll the page to examine the data format. To overcome this the filters that allow for inputs could instead have drop down data to allow the user to select the info they want and the data will be displayed without any issue. Additional enhancements to user interaction would include adding the ability to sort the data by newest to oldest or vice versa. Lastly this data is from over a decade ago, so adding functionality to constantly update with new data will improve the user experience.
